THIS IS NOT A WORKING GAME!

A work in progress Pokemon sample - first time really using JavaScript so probably
will take a while. 

Current state: You are able to walk around with a working walking animation and working collisions.

Next Step: Adding random encounters when you are in the wild grass

Roadmap:
- Add encounters
- Add pokemon
- Unkown from there (working on getting a functional sample first)
